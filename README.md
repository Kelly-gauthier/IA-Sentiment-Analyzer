## AI Sentiment Analyzer (Pro Version)

Welcome to my first Artificial Intelligence project! This application analyzes the emotion in texts in real time.

What I learned and implemented:
- **Advanced Analysis**: Using vaderSentiment to detect nuances and negations
- **Visualization**: Creating dynamic graphs with Pandas and Streamlit.
- **Pro Development**: Setting up a virtual environment (`.venv`) and version control with Git/PyCharm.

## Local Installation
To test my application on your machine:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies: requirements.txt and streamlit
3. Run: streamlit run app.py
